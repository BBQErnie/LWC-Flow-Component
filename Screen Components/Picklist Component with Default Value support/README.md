# Picklist Component with Default Value support
Since the standard picklist flow screen doesn't support setting the default value of the picklist, so you can use this component as a substitute until it's supported out of the box by Salesforce.

For more details about the component, refer this blog post: https://forcepanda.wordpress.com/2020/08/06/flow-screen-component-picklist-component-with-default-value-selection/
