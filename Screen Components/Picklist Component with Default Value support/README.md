# Picklist Component with Default Value support
Since the standard picklist flow screen doesn't support setting the default value of the picklist, so you can use this component as a substitute until it's supported out of the box by Salesforce.

For more details about the component, refer this blog post: < TODO: Add the blogpost link >


To use this component, install this unmanaged package: https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t6F000000cfOx
